Python scripts to plot PECUBE modeling results
==============================================

Xavier Robert, Grenoble,                         

This tool have been set up to help the plot of PECUBE (Braun, 2003; Braun et al., 2012) modeling results.

    - The Plot-Pecube-Forward.py permits to plot predictions versus observations for Pecube forward modeling.

    - The Inversion_plots-XR.py permits to plot the results of NA Inversions (Sambridge, 1999 a & b) with scatter plots and 1D / 2D marginals. To plot the marginals, the results of NA Inversions should be analyzed with NAB.

USAGE
-----
	
Each script shoulb be ran in a terminal with the command : 

.. code-block:: bash

	~$ python Plot-Pecube-Forward.py

or:

.. code-block:: bash

    ~$ python Inversion_plots-XR.py

Please, edit the python files in your text-editor to see the headers in each files to know how to parametrize them.
